                <p>Ward 4 residents are collecting petitions to recall Alderman John La Tour.  During his 15 months in office,
                he has established a record of obstructionism, self-interest, and vulgar humor.  We are happy to help them
                in their efforts to select of a representative that will work in their interests instead of his own.</p>
